//pseudo code

//Variables: Wins, Losses, Guesses Left, Guesses So Far, Computer Guesses

//Generate Computer's random Answer

alphabet.Math.floor(Math.random()* alphabet.length) 

//Generate the User's guess

//Compare User Guess vs. Computer Answer; if the User guesses right, Win # goes up. If incorrect, then different guesses until guesses left are available. When the user does not get the correct answer after the provided number of guesses, then the Loss # goes up.
